        <img src="images/playstation.jpg" class="left-img" height="150" width="200" alt="images.jpeg">
        <p>This platform all started with the original PlayStation. The brainchild of Sony executive Ken Kutaragi, PlayStation’s first console was born out of a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. The two companies collaborated in 1988 to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. This inspired Kutaragi to put forward the idea of a standalone product that used CDs instead of cartridges.That idea evolved into the PlayStation, which has gone on to become one of the best-selling gaming platforms ever. The first console sold 100 million units. That was quickly surpassed by the PlayStation 2, which became the most popular gaming console of all time when it sold over 155 million units. Now in its fifth incarnation, PlayStation continues to push the boundaries.</p>
