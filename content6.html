        <h3>1.) PlayStation Gaming Platform</h3>
        <img src="images/playstation.jpg" class="left-img" height="150" width="200" alt="images.jpeg">
        <p>This gaming platform began with the original PlayStation, which was created by Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive. The console was a result of a collaboration between Nintendo and Sony in 1988, where they worked on a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. Kutaragi's idea was to create a standalone product that uses CDs instead of cartridges, which eventually led to the birth of the PlayStation. It has since become one of the most successful gaming platforms, with the first console selling 100 million units, and the PlayStation 2 surpassing that with over 155 million units sold.  The PlayStation, now in its fifth generation, continues to innovate and push boundaries.</p>
