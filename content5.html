        <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
        <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is a popular term used to describe the delivery of hosted services over the internet. These services are categorized into three main types of cloud computing, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). A cloud service can be either private or public. A public cloud provides services to anyone on the internet, while a private cloud is a dedicated data center that offers hosted services to a limited number of individuals with specific access and authorization settings. Regardless of whether it is private or public, the primary goal of cloud computing is to provide convenient, scalable access to computing resources and IT services.</p>
