        <h3>What is an operating system?</h3>
        
        <p>The most crucial piece of software that runs on a computer is the operating system. It controls the memory, operations, software, and hardware of the computer. You can converse with the computer using this method even if you don't understand its language. A computer cannot function without an operating system.</p>

        <h3>The Operating System's job</h3>
        <p>The operating system (OS) on your computer controls all of the hardware and software. The majority of the time, multiple computer programs are active at once, all of which require access to the CPU, RAM, and storage of your computer. To ensure that each software receives the resources it need, the operating system orchestrates all of this.</p>

        <h3>Types of Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>Any computer you buy often comes pre-loaded with an operating system. The default operating system that comes with computers is used by the majority of users, however it is possible to update or even switch operating systems. Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux are the three most popular operating systems for personal computers. Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.</p>

       <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
        <img src="images/microsoft-os.jpg" class="right-img" height="150" width="200" alt="images.jpeg">
        <p>Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007). Windows comes pre-loaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.</p>

        <h3>macOS</h3>
        <img src="images/mac-os.jpg" class="left-img" height="150" width="200" alt="images.jpeg">
        <p>macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016). According to StatCounter Global Stats, macOS users account for less than 10% of global operating systems—much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than 80%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.</p>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <img src="images/linux-os.jpg" class="right-img" height="150" width="200" alt="images.jpeg">
        <p>Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is different from proprietary software like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from. According to StatCounter Global Stats, Linux users account for less than 2% of global operating systems. However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.</p>
