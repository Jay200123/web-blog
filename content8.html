        <h4><strong>Top 5 Database Platforms</strong></h4>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Oracle</strong></h5>
        <p>Oracle database developed by Oracle Corporation is the most popular relational database system (RDBMS). Not only Oracle is a RDBMS, but also provides functionality for Cloud, Document Store, Graph DBMS, Key-value storage, BLOG, and PDF Storages. Recently. Oracle just announced autonomous feature that allows database to be intelligent and self-managed.</p>
        <p>Oracle database is a relational database (RDBMS). Relational databases store data in a tabular form of rows and columns. Column of a database table represents the attributes of an entity and rows of a table stores records. An RDBMS that implements object-oriented features such as user-defined types, inheritance, and polymorphism is called an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). Oracle Database has extended the relational model to an object-relational model, making it possible to store complex business models in a relational database.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. MySQL</strong></h5>
        <p>MySQL is world’s most popular database that is open source and free. MySQL was acquired by Oracle as a part of Sun Microsystems acquisition in 2009.In MySQL, the SQL part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases. Depending on your programming environment, you might enter SQL directly (for example, to generate reports), embed SQL statements into code written in another language, or use a language-specific API that hides the SQL syntax.</p>

The current version of SQL Server is SQL Server 2019.Similar to Oracle and MySQL, SQL Server is also a relational database management system (RDBMS). Some popular SQL Server editions are:   Azure SQL Database is the cloud-based version of Microsoft SQL Server, presented as a platform as a service offering on Microsoft Azure.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. PostgreSQL</strong></h5>
        <p>PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database which is gaining popularity in recent years, PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system and can be installed on any popular operating systems including Windows, Unix, and Linux. PostgreSQL is also available on most of the public clouds including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. </p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. MongoDB</strong></h5>
        <p> is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.</p>
