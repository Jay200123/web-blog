        <h3><strong>Number Systems</strong></h3>
        <p>Number systems are systems in mathematics that are used to express numbers in various forms and are understood by computers. A number is a mathematical value used for counting and measuring objects, and for performing arithmetic calculations. Numbers have various categories like natural numbers, whole numbers, rational and irrational numbers, and so on. Similarly, there are various types of number systems that have different properties, like the binary number system, the octal number system, the decimal number system, and the hexadecimal number system.</p>


        <h3><strong>What are Number Systems?</strong></h3>
        <iframe width="620" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ku4KOFQ-bB4"></iframe>
        <p>A number system is a system representing numbers. It is also called the system of numeration and it defines a set of values to represent a quantity. These numbers are used as digits and the most common ones are 0 and 1, that are used to represent binary numbers. Digits from 0 to 9 are used to represent other types of number systems.</p>

        <h3><strong>Number Systems Definition</strong></h3>
        <p>A number system is defined as the representation of numbers by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The value of any digit in a number can be determined by a digit, its position in the number, and the base of the number system. The numbers are represented in a unique manner and allow us to operate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division.</p>

        <h3><strong>Types of Number Systems</strong></h3>
        <p>There are different types of number systems in which the four main types are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary Number System (Base -2)</li>  
            <li>Octal Number System (Base -8)</li>  
            <li>Decimal Number System (Base -10)</li> 
            <li>Hexadecimal Number System (Base -16)</li>     
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Binary Number System</strong></h3>
        <p> The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The numbers in this system have a base of 2. Digits 0 and 1 are called bits and 8 bits together make a byte. The data in computers is stored in terms of bits and bytes. The binary number system does not deal with other numbers such as 2,3,4,5 and so on. For example: 100012, 1111012, 10101012 are some examples of numbers in the binary number system.</p>

        <h3><strong>Octal Number System</strong></h3>
        <p>The octal number system uses eight digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 with the base of 8. The advantage of this system is that it has lesser digits when compared to several other systems, hence, there would be fewer computational errors. Digits like 8 and 9 are not included in the octal number system. Just as the binary, the octal number system is used in minicomputers but with digits from 0 to 7. For example: 358, 238, 1418 are some examples of numbers in the octal number system.</p>

        <h3><strong>Decimal Number System</strong></h3>
        <p>The decimal number system uses ten digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 with the base number as 10. The decimal number system is the system that we generally use to represent numbers in real life. If any number is represented without a base, it means that its base is 10. For example: 72310, 3210, 425710 are some examples of numbers in the decimal number system.</p>

        <h3><strong>Hexadecimal Number System</strong></h3>
        <p>The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits/alphabets: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and A,B,C,D,E,F with the base number as 16. Here, A-F of the hexadecimal system means the numbers 10-15 of the decimal number system respectively. This system is used in computers to reduce the large-sized strings of the binary system. For example, 7B316, 6F16, 4B2A16 are some examples of numbers in the hexadecimal number system.</p>
