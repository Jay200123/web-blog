        <h3><strong>Storage Platforms</strong></h3> 
        <p>A storage performance platform is a new architecture paradigm for virtualized environments. The premise of this new approach to storage is the use of server-side media controlled by hypervisor-integrated software able to provide distributed or clustered platforms with accelerated storage read and write I/O operations. </p>

        <p>A storage performance platform makes use of two things that allow it to provide superior performance to current network-based storage solutions. First is the server-side computing resources such as RAM or flash, since they provide many advantages in terms of performance compared to network-based storage solutions.</p> 
        <p>The second part of this new storage platform is a hypervisor-integrated software installed as kernel modules. This means that I/O access to the accelerated storage resources is done as part of the kernel and not as a separate filler driver inside another virtual machine or a virtual machine itself.</p>
        <h4><strong>Types of Storage Platforms</strong></h4>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1.Object Storage</strong></h5>
        <p>Unlike traditional approaches, object storage does not use a file system hierarchy to store data. Data is stored as objects and every object is assigned its own unique identifier. Users retrieve the stored data object using a unique "claim check" code; its actual location on physical media is abstracted within the pool of storage. This architecture allows for virtually unlimited scalability of the virtual storage pool.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.Software Defined Storage</strong></h5>
        <p>A rising number of vendors are promoting products as software-defined storage, however, at this time there are a variety of interpretations of the term. In general, software-defined storage is the abstraction of storage services from the physical storage hardware. The software abstracts hardware resources, pools them into aggregated capacity, and automates the action of distributing them, as needed, to applications.</p>
